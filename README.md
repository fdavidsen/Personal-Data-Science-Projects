# Personal Data Science Projects
This is a collection of my simple personal projects. I made them for fun and learning purposes.

## Custom Library
[fd_lib](https://github.com/fdavidsen/Personal-Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/fd_lib) is a custom library I created to make my job easier. It includes functionality I use frequently, so I don't have to repeat the same block of code every time I do a project.
